# BJIT

### Introduction

I recently had an empty day, with the only plans being relaxation. I quickly got bored. So I decided to do the next best thing.
Write a JIT compiler targeting ARM64.
I was able to get it into a working state in around ~24 hours. There might be some bugs, but I plan to clean this up later.

### Features

✔️ ARM64 JIT, for maximum performance

✔️ Support user input via ',' syntax

✔️ Optimize compiled instructions

✔️ Compile Brainfuck -> ELF

🚧 Support other architectures

### Usage

#### Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mateocabanal/bjit
cd bjit
cmake -B build
cd build
cmake --build .
./bjit ../bf_tests/hello.bf
```

#### Help Menu
```bjit -h```

#### Compile BF to ARM64 ELF
```bjit -c <output file> <input file>```

### JIT Status
This project might not fit the true definition of a Just-in-Time Compiler.
The code reads a BF file character by character, than compiles the program and executes the resulting instructions.
I think this might make BJIT fall under the category of a AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) Compiler.
