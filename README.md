# BJIT

### Introduction

I recently had an empty day, with the only plans being relaxation. I quickly got bored. So I decided to do the next best thing.
Write a JIT compiler targeting ARM64.
I was able to get it into a working state in around ~24 hours. There might be some bugs, but I plan to clean this up later.

### How does a JIT work?

Coming soon...
